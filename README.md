'Marking Bar' is a World of Warcraft addon designed to: Mark the target, assist the tank, drop a ping!

## About Me
I'm Vandiel, in ATT on Discord (vandiel01) and on Korgath.  I'm by no means a expert programmer/coder, but like to learn and experiment things.  I'm always happy to have some insight and/or improvement to the code.
